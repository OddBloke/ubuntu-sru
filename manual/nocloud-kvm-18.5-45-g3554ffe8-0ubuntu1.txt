These tests have now been integrated in to automation; see
manual/nocloud-all-18.5-45-g3554ffe8-0ubuntu1.txt.

One important note: disco KVM tests are failing due to an underlying issue in
the lxd snap: https://github.com/lxc/lxd/issues/5567; given that we have
success on the lxd and ec2 backends, this seems like a safe failure to accept.
