# Manual upgrade test of oracle

# test procedure
* boot oracle instance (bionic/xenial)
* upgrade to proposed cloud-init 18.4.0 expect to see one traceback from Openstack datasource querying absent metadata url.
* test reboot to ensure orginal OpenStack datasource still intact across reboot
* test cloud-init clean --logs --reboot to see that OpenStack DS still gets detected because Oracle not in datasource_list
* Add Oracle in configurared datasource_list in /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/90-oracle-ds.cfg
* cloud-init clean --logs --reboot
* Ensure Oracle datasource is detected without Tracebacks
