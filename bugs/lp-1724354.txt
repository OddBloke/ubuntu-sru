[Impact]
If python3-jsonschema is not installed, then WARNING will be written
to console log and to /var/log/cloud-init.log with certain cloud-config
data is provided.

python3-jsonschema is a soft dependency of cloud-init and specically
not listed in 16.04 and 17.04 packaging as it was not a dependency in
the versions of cloud-init originally released then.

The WARNING is only "scary", and has no negative affect on runtime.

[Test Case]
The change for this bug modified the integration test suite so
that WARN in /var/log/cloud-init would trigger a test failure.
Running the integration testsuite would show this failure with
that test now in place.

A manual test can be done though as follows.

$ cat > my.cfg <<EOF
#cloud-config
bootcmd:
  - "cat /proc/uptime > /run/bootcmd-works"
runcmd:
  - "cat /proc/uptime > /run/runcmd-works"
EOF

$ for r in zesty xenial; do
   lxc init $r-proposed $r-info &&
   lxc-pstart $r-info \
     sh -c 'dpkg-query --show cloud-init; cat /etc/cloud/build.info' &&
     lxc delete --force $r-info; done

# show container info just to show versions.
$ for r in zesty xenial; do
   lxc init $r-proposed $r-info >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo == $r-info == &&
   lxc-pstart $r-info -- \
      sh -xc 'dpkg-query --show cloud-init; cat /etc/cloud/build.info' &&
   lxc delete --force $r-info; done

## launch an instance of each release and grab logs.
$ for rel in xenial zesty; do
   n=$rel-1724354
   lxc launch $rel-proposed $n "--config=user.user-data=$(cat my.cfg)"
   lxc exec $n -- sh -c \
      'while ! [ -e /run/cloud-init/result.json ]; do echo -n .; sleep 1; done; echo'
   lxc file pull $n/var/log/cloud-init.log $n-cloud-init.log
done

# check that 1724354 is installed.
$ grep "WARN" *-1724354-cloud-init.log

[Regression Potential]
Highest chance for regression would be in the integration test
suite.  The only change in code path is in cloudinit/config/schema.py:
 - logging.warning(
 + logging.debug(
