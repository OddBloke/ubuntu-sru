[Impact]
Upgrades of cloud-init on official Ubuntu 16.04 and 17.10 images
running on IBM public cloud will be unreachable after a reboot.

This is because cloud-init incorrectly recognizes the newly added
'IBMCloud' as the datasource to use and skips use of the previously used
ConfigDrive or NoCloud datasource.  This is because
a.) Official 16.04 and 17.10 images of Ubuntu have seeded data
 in their /var/lib/cloud/seed/ directory that was used on first
 boot and should be continued to be used.
b.) IBMCloud's datasource in some scenarios appears looks similar
 to that of Config Drive.  The version of cloud-init in xenial and
 artful checks to disable config-drive in order to identify the
 IBMCloud datasource.  That should not happen unless the IBMCloud
 datasource is enabled, which is configured off in those images.

The fix is to continue using the existing datasource on those images.

[Test Case]
 * Launch an image on IBM public cloud.
 * add -proposed
 * apt-get update && apt-get install cloud-init
 * reboot
 * ssh back in

If you are able to ssh back in, then this bug has been fixed.

VM_IP=`launch-softlayer --pubkey-file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -u sethostname.yaml -i os:xenial | awk '/primary ip/{printf "root@%s", $3}'`
ssh $VM_IP -- dpkg-query --show cloud-init;
ssh $VM_IP -- cloud-init status --long;
ssh $VM_IP -- sh -c '
  mirror=http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
  echo deb $mirror $(lsb_release -sc)-proposed main | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/proposed.list
  apt-get update -q
  apt-get install -qy cloud-init';
ssh $VM_IP -- DEBUG_LEVEL=2 DI_LOG=stderr /usr/lib/cloud-init/ds-identify --force 2>&1 | grep provision
ssh $VM_IP -- dpkg-query --show cloud-init;
ssh $VM_IP -- cloud-init clean --logs --reboot;
ssh $VM_IP -- cloud-init status --long;

[Regression Potential]
This specific fix is tightly contained down the path involved in
IBM cloud.   The most likely failure scenario would be failure
in 18.04 images which do not have the additional datasources built
into the images.
