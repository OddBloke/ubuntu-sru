=== Begin SRU Template ===
[Impact]
Unnecessary metadata crawling of OpenStack datasources on Ec2 platforms slowing boot time.

[Test Case]
Deploy and Ec2 Xenial instance which does not support strict cloud-id mode which attempts OpenStack datasource discovery before Ec2 discovery. Ensure no metadata addresses are crawled during OpenStackLocal discovery.

$ launch-ec2 --series xenial
$ egrep 'Ec2|OpenStackLocal|169.254' /var/log/cloud-init.log"  | head -n 10 # should not see any 169.254 queries within OpenStackLocal discovery


[Regression Potential]
None, if OpenStack traceback occurs, Ec2Local is still detected as fallback
