[Impact]

On misconfigured OpenStack clouds, unknown network types might be exposed to
instances.  Currently, cloud-init will traceback when presented with such
network types, meaning that users have to make changes to cloud-init in their
images before they can successfully launch.

This change fixes the traceback and converts it to a warning, meaning that
cloud-init will do its best to boot on these misconfigured clouds.

[Test Case]

Launch an image with the -proposed cloud-init on one such misconfigured cloud
and confirm that cloud-init handles the unknown network type gracefully.

(The cloud-init team don't have access to such a cloud, and nor does the
original reporter.)

[Regression Potential]

cloud-init's behaviour in misconfigured clouds couldn't get worse, as it was
crashing.  Ensuring that network configuration on well-configured clouds hasn't
regressed will be covered by the regular manual OpenStack test run.
