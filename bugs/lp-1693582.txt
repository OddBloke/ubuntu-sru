=== Begin SRU Template ===
[Impact]
This code path is only exercised on GCE datasources and in such cases get_data
would have not configured GCE-configured authorized ssh keys for the default user.

[Test Case]
Launch an instance on GCE
Update cloud-init deb
run sudo cloud-init single -n cc_ntp
curl -H "Metadata-Flavor: Google" http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/attributes/ssh-keys
validate .ssh/authorized_keys contains keys listed in the above curl

[Regression Potential]
GCE instances with don't support instance/attributes/ssh-keys would only be able
to configure ssh access via #cloud-config ssh declarations.
