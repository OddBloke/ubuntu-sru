[Impact] 
When cloud-init sees 'ip=' on the kernel command line, it will take
the networking configuration that is written by the ipconfig tool,
and convert it into the proper network config for the system
(/etc/network/interfaces).

This works well for the 'ip=dhcp' and 'ip=dhcp6' cases, but did not
work correctly for the "statick" path with a command line like:
   ip=<client-ip>::<gw-ip>:<netmask>:<hostname>:device:...

Cloud-init would stack trace when trying to bring up this networking
resulting in a system that did not boot properly.

[Test Case]
The basic idea below is:
 a.) launch an instance with proposed version of cloud-init.
 b.) inside instance, use cloud-init's net library to convert
     'net-eth1.cfg' into a different format, and the render that format
     using cloud-init's trunk tool 'net-convert.py'

## launch an instance.
$ release=xenial
$ ref=$release-proposed
$ lxc-proposed-snapshot --proposed --publish $release $ref
$ lxc launch $ref $name
$ lxc exec $ref $name /bin/bash

## get render tool
% wget https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cloud-init/+bug/1691135/+attachment/4888001/+files/bug-1691135.sh -O bug-1691135.sh
% sh ./bug-1691135.sh

## if that runs to completion, then it will show the /etc/network/interfaces
## file and the netplan etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml file.
## if it fails it will stack trace.

As seen in the upstream commit, the change is in a very focused path,
only changing something when the protocol was 'static'.

[Regression Potential] 
Potential for regression would be limited to the 'ip=' command line path.
