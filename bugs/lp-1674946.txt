[Impact]
When a config drive provides network_data.json on Openstack running on
ESXi cloud-init will fail to configure networking.

Console log and /var/log/cloud-init.log will show:
 ValueError: Unknown network_data link type: hyperv

This woudl also occur when the type of the network device as declared
to cloud-init was 'hw_veb', 'hyperv', or 'vhostuser'.

[Test Case]
Launch an instance with config drive on hyperv cloud.

[Regression Potential]
Low to none. cloud-init is relaxing requirements and will accept things
now that it previously complained were invalid.

This is very similar to change in bug 1642679.
Upstream Openstack Merge proposal to stop this from continually
happening at https://review.openstack.org/#/c/400883/
