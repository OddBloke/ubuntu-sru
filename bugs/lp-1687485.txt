[Impact]
This code path is not applicable to Ubuntu.
The bug resolved properly detecting and raising ValueErrors if multiple default
gateways were defined in ipv4 or or ipv6 addresses for sysconfig
(Redhat/centos) format.

[Test Case]
Launch an instance on lxd, make sure it has network.

[Regression Potential]
Changes to network rendering could have negatively affected Ubuntu
the test above is valid to check that that didn't go horribly wrong.
