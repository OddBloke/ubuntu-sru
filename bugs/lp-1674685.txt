[Impact]
The network device on Azure is configured via dhcp. DNS records are
updated for the host with the dhcp's request (dyndns).

Cloud-init has two operation modes on Azure.
a.) builtin: cloud-init does negotiation with the "fabric" (cloud platform)
    directly.
b.) interaction with walinux-agent: cloud-init invokes walinux-agent
    and expects it to do negotiation.

The system's hostname is provided to cloud-init via info on a cdrom.
cloud-init reads that hostname and then updates the system's hostname.
When configured to use walinux-agent, cloud-init would then bounce
the network device to publish this hostname change.

The bug here was that this did not happen in the builtin path, and
as a result systems would not have dns updated for their hostname.

This is not a problem for xenial or yakkety as they use the
walinuxagent path.

[Test Case]
To verify no regression
start an instance on azure
enable proposed, update, upgrade
rm -Rf /var/lib/cloud /var/log/cloud-init*
reboot

[Regression Potential]
Regression risk is very low since this code path is not used in 16.04 or
16.10. The changed code path is only used in 17.04+. Thus the test case
listed above is simple instance boot.
