=== Begin SRU Template ===
[Impact]
Artful daily images dropped ifupdown package and as a result, no dhcp lease files exist in /var/lib/dhclient/*leases.
Azure couldn't find the metadata service adddress from dhcp option 245 in this case.


[Test Case]

# spawn Azure instance in Xenial/zesty and confirm isc-dhclient leases are still processed correctly.
$ ssh ubuntu@azure-xenial


# Update to <series>-proposed and clean reboot so proposed cloud-init runs
ubuntu@azure$ sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list ... %s/ xenial / xenial-proposed /
ubuntu@azure$ sudo apt update
ubuntu@azure$ sudo apt install cloud-init
ubuntu@azure$ dpkg-query show cloud-init
ubuntu@azure$ sudo rm /var/lib/cloud /var/log/cloud*; sudo reboot
# Recheck with proposed run
$ ssh ubuntu@<azure-instance>
ubuntu@azure-xenial$ grep 'Finding Azure endpoint from hook json...' /var/log/cloud-init.log
ubuntu@azure-xenial$ grep 'Azure endpoint found at'  # success


[Regression Potential]
systemd networkd checks are done first before isc-dhclient lease parsing. On non-systemd environments, it's possible that this fix could traceback if it doesn't handle non-systemd environments. Check Azure & Cloudstack to make sure proposed doesn't regress.
