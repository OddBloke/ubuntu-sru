[Impact] 
The only way to assign a hashed password to a user is to use passwd within a
users entry like this:
 users:
   - name: root
     passwd: $6$Cl....Hy$IEJciQZLxQLzkST......g.bzqf3lUl.

But, if that user is already present on the system, cloud-init would skip
setting the password.  The change was to add support for providing
encrypted passwords to 'chpasswd' as:

 chpasswd:
   list: |
     user:$5$eriogqzq$Dg7PxHsKGzziuEGkZgkLvacjuEFeljJ.rLf.hZqKQLA

[Test Case]
There is an integration test in cloud-init that runs though this code.
To run that:

$ git clone https://git.launchpad.net/cloud-init
$ cd cloud-init

# download the appropriate deb for cloud-init from -proposed
$ rel=xenial
$ pver=$(rmadison --url=ubuntu --suite=$rel-proposed cloud-init | awk '{print $3}')
$ fname="cloud-init_${pver}_all.deb"
$ wget "http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/c/cloud-init/$fname"
$ ln -sf $fname cloud-init_all.$rel.deb
$ tox -e citest -- run -v -n $rel --deb=cloud-init_all.$rel.deb \
   -t tests/cloud_tests/testcases/modules/set_password_list_string.py \
   -t tests/cloud_tests/testcases/modules/set_password_list.py

That will install the new cloud-init into a container and run
with user data to excercise this new feature.

[Regression Potential] 
Some user passwords provided via chpasswd and starting with '$'
may be interpreted as hashed passwords.
Specifically, those matching: r'\$[1,2a,2y,5,6](\$.+){2}'

In english, that regex is:
  - starts with a '$' 
  - followed by '1', '2a', '2y', '5', '6'
  - followed by a $
  - followed by 1 or more characters
  - followed by another $
  - followed by 1 or more characters

So a total of 3 '$' and starting with one of those specific 3 or 4
character strings.  That could definitely happen, but it is low odds, and
also fairly low risk.  If a user hits this, they'd be unable to reach a new
instance.
