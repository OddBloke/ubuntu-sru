[Impact] 
VMs on MS Azure have an ephemeral disk attached to them.  On first boot,
the disk has a empty ntfs formated filesystem.  Cloud-init is expected
to notice that the empty ntfs filesystem should be reformatted with
a more linux-friendly ext4 filesystem.  This function is working as
expected.

However, the user can 'redeploy' a VM to a new azure host, or stop and
deallocate the vm for some time and then restart/reallocate the vm.  After
that operation, a pristine ephemeral disk is attached.  Cloud-init is
expected to re-format this pristine ephemeral disk, but clearly not
reformat a disk with user's data on it.  On large (L32) size VMs, azure
presents a GPT formatted disk with 2 partitions where the second partition
is ntfs.  Cloud-init currently does not consider disks with 2 partitions
to be re-formattable.

[Test Case]
Test cases:
 1. Deploy an L32(s) VM on Azure
 2. Log in and ensure that the ephemeral disk is formatted and mounted to /mnt
 3. Via the portal you can "Redeploy" the VM to a new Azure Host (or alternatively stop and deallocate the VM for some time, and then restart/reallocate the VM).

Expected Results:
 - After reallocation we expect the ephemeral disk to be formatted and mounted to /mnt.

Actual Results:
 - After reallocation /mnt is not mounted and there are errors in the cloud-init log.
