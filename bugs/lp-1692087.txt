[Impact] 
The disk setup module (disk_setup) of cloud-init had several issues
when dealing with GPT formatted devices.  The result was that the user
didn't get expected behavior if they were requesting GPT disk labels
or if the disk present already had a GPT label.

[Test Case]
1.) launch an instance with a second disk "/dev/vdb".
    This can be done on openstack or azure.

2.) write a config to system.
   $ sudo tee /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/disk-setup.cfg <EOF
#cloud-config
disk_setup:
  /dev/vdb:
    table_type: gpt
    layout: [66, [33, 82]]
    overwrite: True
fs_setup:
 - device: /dev/vdb
   partition: 1
   filesystem: ext4
 - device: /dev/vdb
   partition: 2
   filesystem: swap
mounts:
    - ["/dev/vdb1", "/mnt"]
EOF

3. Partition the second disk with a gpt partition table.
   download a paritioning tool and use it.
   $ wget https://git.launchpad.net/~smoser/cloud-init/+git/sru-info/tree/bugs/lp-1686514/disk-setup -O disk-setup
   # format /dev/vdb with GPT disk label and 2 partitions.
   $ sudo LABEL=gpt ./disk-setup ntfs2 /dev/vdb

4. remove state from the instance and reboot.  We expect that the desired
   partitioning will be done and the mount written and used on reboot.

   $ sudo rm -Rf /var/lib/cloud/ /var/log/cloud-init*
   $ sudo reboot

5. ssh back in and look around
   $ grep vdb /proc/mounts 
   $ grep mnt /etc/fstab

   $ sfdisk -l /dev/vdb

6. sudo reboot
7. ssh back in and look around.
