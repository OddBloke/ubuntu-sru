[Impact]
On Openstack instances, cloud-init incorrectly rendered netplan
configuration files.  The result is that networking does not work
as expected.

Note that this is not a default configuration on any Ubuntu provided images.
Default images use ifupdown (eni) rendering which did not have this issue.

[Test Case]
The basic idea below is:
 a.) launch an instance with proposed version of cloud-init.
 b.) inside instance, get cloud-init's network rendering tool from trunk
 c.) run the rendering tool against a config that failed before.
 d.) check rendered netplan config to verify it has the correct format.
     The failed output would have 'addresses' with a format like:
     172.19.1.34/255.255.255.0
     The expected output would be 'cidr' format:
     172.19.1.34/24

## launch an instance.
$ release=xenial
$ ref=$release-proposed
$ lxc-proposed-snapshot --proposed --publish $release $ref
$ lxc init $ref $name

## get render tool
$ wget https://git.launchpad.net/~cloud-init-dev/cloud-init/plain/tools/net-convert.py -O net-convert.py

## write the network_data.json
$ cat >network_data.json <<EOF
{
 "links": [
  {"ethernet_mac_address": "aa:ab:ac:ad:ae:00",
   "id": "tap1a", "type": "phy", "vif_id": "1a81968a"}
 ],
 "networks": [
   {"id": "network0", "ip_address": "172.19.1.34", "link": "tap1a",
    "netmask": "255.255.255.0", "network_id": "dacd568d", "type": "ipv4",
    "routes": [
     {"gateway": "172.19.3.254", "netmask": "0.0.0.0",
      "network": "0.0.0.0"}]}
 ],
 "services": [{"address": "172.19.0.12", "type": "dns"}]
}
EOF

## run the converter
$ ./net-convert.py --network-data=network_data.json \
     --kind=network_data.json --output-kind=netplan \
     -m eth1,aa:ab:ac:ad:ae:00 --directory=./out.d 


## check the output
$ cat out.d/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
network:
    version: 2
    ethernets:
        eth1:
            addresses:
            - 172.19.1.34/24
            match:
                macaddress: aa:ab:ac:ad:ae:00
            nameservers:
                addresses:
                - 172.19.0.12
            routes:
            -   to: 0.0.0.0/0
                via: 172.19.3.254
            set-name: eth1

## show the cloud-init versions
$ dpkg-query --show cloud-init
...

[Regression Potential] 
The change is fairly safe in that it basically renders:
  172.19.1.34/24
instead of
  172.19.1.34/255.255.255.0

The previous rendering just plain did not work as it is not valid
input for netplan.  So the regression path there should be low.

The common code changes could shake out other failures in the networking
path.

lxc-proposed-snapshot is

It publishes an image to lxd with proposed enabled and cloud-init upgraded.
