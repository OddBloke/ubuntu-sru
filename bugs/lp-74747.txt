[Impact]

This aligns cloud-init's behaviour with the sources.list shipped in Ubuntu
images.  Without this, Ubuntu instances with/without cloud-init running end up
with inconsistent sources.lists.

[Test Case]

for SERIES in xenial bionic cosmic; do
   echo '=== BEGIN ' $SERIES;
   ref=$SERIES-proposed;
   lxc delete test-$SERIES --force 2> /dev/null;
   lxc-proposed-snapshot -p -P $SERIES $ref | egrep 'Creating|cloud-init';
   lxc launch $ref test-$SERIES;
   lxc exec test-$SERIES -- cloud-init status --wait --long;
   lxc exec test-$SERIES grep ^deb-src /etc/apt/sources.list || echo "SUCCESS"
done


[Regression Potential]

Some users may be relying on the deb-src lines being enabled by default.  In
general, any users who are doing something that relies on deb-src lines will
know where to look for the issue and how to go about re-enabling them.

Given the number of Ubuntu instances that this will improve performance for,
and that this is aligning cloud-init with Ubuntu's intended default behaviour,
we believe this to be an acceptable risk.
