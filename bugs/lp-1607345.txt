=== Begin SRU Template ===
[Impact]
ubuntu-bug cloud-init now collects cloud-init-related information for a bug-report

[Test Case]

# Launch instance under test
$ for release in xenial zesty;
  do
    ref=$release-proposed;
    lxc-proposed-snapshot --proposed --publish $release $ref;
    lxc launch $ref $name;
    sleep 10;
    lxc exec $name ubuntu-bug cloud-init  # And follow the prompts to report a bogus bug
  done

[Regression Potential]
Worst case scenario is the apport wrapper doesn't work and the developer has to file a bug manually instead.
