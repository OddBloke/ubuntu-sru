=== Begin SRU Template ===
[Impact]
cloud-init subcommands analyze and schema don't work on the commandline.
The developer would instead need to run python3 -m 'cloudinit.cmd.main devel schema'.

[Test Case]

# Launch instance under test
$ for release in xenial zesty;
  do
    ref=$release-proposed;
    lxc-proposed-snapshot --proposed --publish $release $ref;
    lxc launch $ref $name;
    sleep 10;
    lxc exec $name cloud-init analyze;
    lxc exec $name cloud-init devel schema --doc;
  done

[Regression Potential]
Regression potential is minimal as this path is only executed manually by developers when triaging a system.
