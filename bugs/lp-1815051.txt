[Impact]

cloud-init will render invalid netplan YAML for (some) valid network
configurations, rendering it incapable of configuring some networking setups.

[Test Case]

```
cat > lp-1815051.yaml << EOF
version: 1
config:
    - type: physical
      name: eth0
      subnets:
          - type: dhcp
            control: auto
    - type: physical
      name: eth1
      subnets:
          - type: dhcp
            control: auto
    - type: physical
      name: eth2
      subnets:
          - type: dhcp
            control: auto
    - type: bond
      name: bond1
      bond_interfaces: [eth0]
      params:
          bond-mode: active-backup
      subnets:
        - type: static
          address: 172.20.80.4/25
    - type: bond
      name: bond2
      bond_interfaces: [eth1]
      params:
          bond-mode: active-backup
      subnets:
        - type: static
          address: 172.20.90.4/25
    - type: vlan
      name: bond1.3502
      vlan_id: 3502
      vlan_link: bond1
      subnets:
        - type: static
          address: 172.20.40.4/25
    - type: vlan
      name: bond1.3500
      vlan_id: 3500
      vlan_link: bond1
      subnets:
        - type: static
          address: 172.20.50.4/25
    - type: nameserver
      address: [8.8.8.8]

done
```

[Regression Potential]

This change modifies the output netplan YAML to exclude YAML anchors; netplan
doesn't use these, so the only regression potential with the modified behaviour
is if some other tool is parsing the netplan configuration.  This seems
unlikely.

The behaviour modifies the YAML generation path for all network configuration,
so it's possible that this could be regressed; the above test case and the
manual tests should combine to confirm that this regression has not occurred.
