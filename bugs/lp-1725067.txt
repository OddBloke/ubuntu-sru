[Impact]
Growing the root partition would if:
 a.) if the device /dev/root did not exist
 b.) the kernel command line included PARTUUID=<value>

[Test Case]
get-proposed-image is
  https://github.com/cloud-init/qa-scripts/blob/master/scripts/get-proposed-cloudimg
It downloads a cloud image of a given release, and then creates a -proposed
image with cloud-init upgraded.

A script 'recreate.sh' will run each of the steps below automated.
  https://github.com/cloud-init/ubuntu-sru/blob/master/bugs/lp-1684869/recreate.sh


1.) get a (proposed) disk image image.
  and convert it to raw so you can read the partuuid with sfdisk
  (get-proposed-image does this, if not,
  'qemu-img convert -O raw orig.img orig.raw')
  ./get-proposed-image

2.) get the partition uuid of the first partition
   # for xenial images that are dos partition table rather than gpt
   # we need to convert that with:
   #    sgdisk --mbrtogpt $raw
   $ raw=yakkety-server-cloudimg-amd64-proposed.raw
   $ ptuuid=$(sfdisk --part-uuid $raw 1)

3.) create a nocloud seed
   $ printf "%s\n%s\n%s\n%s\n" "#cloud-config" "password: passw0rd" \
        "chpasswd: {expire: False}" "ssh_pwauth: True" > my-user-data
   $ echo "instance-id: $(uuidgen || echo i-abcdefg)" > my-meta-data
   $ cloud-localds my-seed.img my-user-data my-meta-data

4.) extract kernel from inside the image
   $ sudo mount-image-callback $raw -- mchroot sh -xc 'cat /boot/vmlinu?-*' > kernel

5.) boot instance with disk backed by the raw disk above.

   $ qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b $raw disk.img 10G
   $ qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm \
       -drive file=disk.img,if=ide,index=0 -drive file=my-seed.img,if=ide \
       -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 \
       -snapshot -m 768 -nographic -echr 0x05 \
       -kernel kernel \
       -append "root=PARTUUID=${ptuuid} ro console=tty1 console=ttyS0"

6.) log in, verify / has been resized.
   log in with 'ubuntu' and password 'passw0rd'
    $ df -h /
    Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/root       9.6G 1009M  8.6G  11% /


[Regression Potential]
Regressions would surface as the root filesystem not being correctly resized.
The user would find themselves with not as much disk as expected.

[Other Info]
The qemu-system-x86 command above uses ide devices.  This is because
the ide device emulated by qemu is built into the -generic kernel,
while the more common virtio-block or virtio-scsi are not.  If you
attach those device types, it will fail with 'cant find root'.

Note that this was a regression of changes added in
 * bug 1684869: growing root partition does not always work with root=PARTUUID=
 * bug 1677376: growing partitions does not work when booted without initramfs

The issue probably is only seen if using the version of cloud-init
in xenial-proposed.  Zesty and artful kernels or userspace made the change
actually not regress.  However we will verify functionality for the uploaded
version in each of x, z, a.
