=== Begin SRU Template ===
[Impact] 
On a system booted with both ip6= and ip= on the kernel command line
cloud-init will raise an exception and fail to process user-data and
have its normal affect on boot.

That is because cloud-init previously raised an exception when more
than one file in /run/net*.conf declared the same DEVICE.  Changes to
isc-dhcp and initramfs-tools have changed their behavior and cloud-init
has to adjust to allow DEVICE6= and DEVICE= in separate files.

[Test Case]
Boot a system on a network with both ipv4 and ipv6 dhcp servers,
and pass kernel command line with:
  ip=dhcp ip6=dhcp

[Regression Potential] 
Regression seems unlikely as this is relaxing a check.  Where previously
an exception would have been raised, cloud-init will now go on.

So it seems most likely, something that didn't work before (due to raised
exception) would now still not work, but with failures.  That is not
expected, but that would likely be where regressions were found.
