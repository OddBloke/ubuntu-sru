[Impact]
Minimal as the use-case is developers testing clean boot scenario.

Command line utility 'cloud-init clean' in containers would emit an error and wouldn't clean all cloud-init artifacts. Users would need to remove cloud-init logs and /var/lib/cloud subdirs manually if they wanted to test a clean boot scenario.

Error message:  'Cannot call rmtree on a symbolic link'


[Test Case]
lxc launch ubuntu-daily:bionic myb1;
lxc exec myb1 -- ls -l /var/lib/cloud;
lxc exec myb1 -- cloud-init clean
