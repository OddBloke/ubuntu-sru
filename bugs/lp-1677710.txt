=== Begin SRU Template ===
[Impact] 
On systems deployed with MAAS xenial and yakkety systems would put a
warning on the login screen stating that the datasource was not found.

[Test Case]
The full test case involves 
 * deploying through MAAS 
 * enabling -proposed (without -proposed should show failure)
 * setting curtin config to show:
   system_upgrade: {enabled: True}}

[Regression Potential] 
The changes did
 a.) renamed some variables to make code more readable
 b.) make searching for config less restrictive

due to 'a', there could be unintended bugs, but testing for
other datasources would likely have turned that up.
