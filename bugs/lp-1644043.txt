=== Begin SRU Template ===
[Impact] 
Unit tests would fail, causing build failure.

[Test Case]
Run cloud-init tests a system with a network device named 'eth0'
Building cloud-init runs the unit tests, so even just building on
such a system is sufficient.

lxc provides such an environment.

Generally, the build worked, so unit tests passed.

[Regression Potential] 
None: unit test changes only.
