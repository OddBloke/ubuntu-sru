[Impact]
Preprovisioning state of off prevents cloud-init crawling the metadata service and running module configuration during system setup until the IMDS tells the node the approriate IP to talk to metadata.
If preprovisioning is not set up properly, Azure instances would never finish cloud-init configuration and instances will not be accessible via ssh.

[Test Case]

Covered by manual azure testing (otherwise the instance would never come up)
