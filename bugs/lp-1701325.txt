[Impact]
lxc containers would show warnings in /var/log/cloud-init.log.
This was because attempts were made to read dmi information from
inside the (unpriviledged) container.  Such attempts to read
dmi data like /sys/class/dmi/id/product_serial would then result
in an attempt to run dmidecode which would also fail.

[Test Case]
To test this, simply
a.) create an lxd instance from a image with -proposed version of cloud-init
   $ release=xenial
   $ ref=$release-1701325
   $ lxc-proposed-snapshot --proposed --publish $release $ref
   $ lxc launch $ref $name
b.) lxc exec $name -- grep WARN /var/log/cloud-init.log

[Regression Potential]
A regression caused by this change is possible on some system where 
systemd identified the system as a container but the container platform provided
simulated/virtualized dmi information in /sys/class/dmi/id.

The check for for container is done with:
  systemd-detect-virt --quite --container

[Other Info]
Upstream commit at

This was actually a regression of the upstream fix for bug 1691772.
That never entered a stable Ubuntu release.  The testing here is
actually a test against regression.
The upstream commit for that change is at
  https://git.launchpad.net/cloud-init/commit/?id=802e7cb2da

lxc-proposed-snapshot is
  https://git.launchpad.net/~smoser/cloud-init/+git/sru-info/tree/bin/lxc-proposed-snapshot
It publishes an image to lxd with proposed enabled and cloud-init upgraded.
