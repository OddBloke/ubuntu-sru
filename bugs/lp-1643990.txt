[Impact] 
Cloud-init's logging is inconsistent due to availability of syslog during
boot.

Cloud-init logs to /var/log/cloud-init.log by default.  It does this in
a way that was originally designed to prefer to use syslog if it was
available, and then fall back to writing directly to that file.

Over time this has been shown to be problematic.
a.) it relied on syslog during boot, and on some distros it wasn't
    present.
b.) sometimes it would not be available during cloud-init-local.service
    and then would be during cloud-init.service.  The result was that
    the log would have two different time stamp formats (one written
    by rsyslog and one by python logging).
c.) if rsyslog was used, micro seconds were not included in the log.
d.) since the move to systemd, there has even been times when cloud-init's
    attempt to determine if syslog was available would false-positive.
    that would result logging not being written to the file at all.

Over all, the complexity was just not found to worth the benefit.

[Test Case]
  * Launch an instance.
  * Look at /var/log/cloud-init.log.
    on start, the cloud-int process logs a message like
      'Cloud-init v 0.7.8 running'
    Look at those messages specifically.  In the example here (lxd), neither
    cloud-init.service or cloud-init-local.service successfully logged at all.

    # grep Cloud-init /var/log/cloud-init.log 
    Dec  2 18:06:56 y2 [CLOUDINIT] util.py[DEBUG]: Cloud-init v. 0.7.8 running 'modules:config' at Fri, 02 Dec 2016 18:06:56 +0000. Up 5.0 seconds.
    Dec  2 18:06:58 y2 [CLOUDINIT] util.py[DEBUG]: Cloud-init v. 0.7.8 running 'modules:final' at Fri, 02 Dec 2016 18:06:58 +0000. Up 7.0 seconds.
    Dec  2 18:06:58 y2 [CLOUDINIT] util.py[DEBUG]: Cloud-init v. 0.7.8 finished at Fri, 02 Dec 2016 18:06:58 +0000. Datasource DataSourceNoCloud [seed=/var/lib/cloud/seed/nocloud-net][dsmode=net].  Up 7.0 seconds

  * update to proposed, cleanup reboot
    # enable propose and update
    # cleanup

    sudo rm -Rf /var/log/cloud-init* /var/lib/cloud/
    sudo reboot
    
  * login again and look.

    This time, all messages will have the format:
       2016-12-02 17:58:43,175 - util.py[DEBUG]: Cloud-init v. 0.7.8 running 'init-local' at Fri, 02 Dec 2016 17:58:43 +0000. Up 13.73 seconds.

    And you will have one for each 'init-local', 'init', 'modules:config' and
    modules:final.

[Regression Potential] 
Users relying on cloud-init writing entries to syslog will lose that.
