[Impact] 
An ephemeral disk will not correctly be mounted on /mnt.
This affects Azure and other instances where an ephemeral device is
mounted by default on /mnt. It is recreated in Azure and on OpenStack.

This can be mitigated by either:
 1.) mount -a
 2.) reboot

[Test Case]
In a correctly functioning image on OpenStack or Azure, you should be
able to:

1.) Launch an instance
2.) ssh into instance and look around
   $ awk '$2 == "/mnt" { print $0 }' /etc/fstab
   /dev/vdb /mnt auto defaults,nofail,x-systemd.requires=cloud-init.service,comment=cloudconfig 0 2

   $ awk '$2 == "/mnt" { print $0 }' /proc/mounts
   /dev/vdb /mnt vfat rw,relatime,fmask=0022,dmask=0022,codepage=437,iocharset=iso8859-1,shortname=mixed,errors=remount-ro 0 0

   $ df -h /mnt
   Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on
   /dev/vdb 40G 32K 40G 1% /mnt

To check that this is functional with -proposed, after you've seen it failed

3.) enable -proposed and apt-get install cloud-init
4.) clean up and reboot as if fresh:
    sudo rm -Rf /var/lib/cloud /var/log/cloud-init
    sudo sed -i '/cloudconfig/d' /etc/fstab
    sudo reboot

[Regression Potential] 
This is a regression caused by bug 1611074, so in addition to the above
test case, we should go through the test cases shown there to see that
those also work.
