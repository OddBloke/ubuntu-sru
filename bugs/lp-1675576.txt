[Impact] 
Writing netplan configuration during cloud-init's local phase
does not work properly.  This is because there is stale configuration
from the default installed files in a Ubuntu core image.

The change to cloud-initn was to clean those up so that it could
invoke netplan apply.

[Test Case]
Unit tests were added that excercise this code, full functional
test would run through ubuntu core.  To do this on ubuntu cloud images
we will simulate.

lxc-proposed-snapshot is 
  https://git.launchpad.net/~smoser/cloud-init/+git/sru-info/tree/bin/lxc-proposed-snapshot
It publishes an image to lxd with proposed enabled and cloud-init upgraded.

[Regression Potential] 
This code could delete a users netplan config incorrectly.
That is protected against the config being *exactly* as shown above,
and also named exactly as above.
