[Impact]
A cloud-config that contains packages to install (see below) or
'package_upgrade' will run 'apt-get update'.  That can sometimes fail as a
result of contention with the apt-daily.service that updates that information.

Cloud-config showing the problem is just like:

  $ cat my.yaml
  #cloud-config
  packages: ['hello']

[Test Case]
lxc-proposed-snapshot is 
  https://git.launchpad.net/~smoser/cloud-init/+git/sru-info/tree/bin/lxc-proposed-snapshot
It publishes an image to lxd with proposed enabled and cloud-init upgraded.

a.) launch an instance with proposed version of cloud-init and some user-data.
   This is platform independent.  The test case demonstrates lxd.
   $ printf "%s\n%s\n%s\n" "#cloud-config" "packages: ['hello']" \
       "package_upgrade: true" > config.yaml
   $ release=xenial
   $ ref=proposed-$release
   $ ./lxc-proposed-snapshot --proposed --publish $release $ref;

b.) start the instance
   $ name=$release-1693361
   $ lxc launch my-xenial "--config=user.user-data=$(cat config.yaml)
   $ sleep 1
   $ lxc exec $name -- tail -f /var/log/cloud-init.log /var/log/cloud-init-output.log 
   # watch this boot.

 c.) Look for evidence of systemd failure
   journalctl -o short-precise | grep -i break
   journalctl -o short-precise | grep -i order

[Regression Potential]
Regression chance here is low.  Its possible that ordering dependencies
could occur.  When that does happen, journalctl will mention it.  Unfortunately
in such cases systemd somewhat randomly picks a service to kil so behavior
is somewhat undefined.
