[Impact]
Landscape client could not properly configure /etc/landscape/client.conf in py3 environments.

[Test Case]
The basic idea below is:
 a.) init an instance with proposed version of cloud-init
 b.) update user-data for the lxc to specify known working landscape-client
     config for a landscape.canonical.com account.
 c.) Ensure  client.conf is updated appropriately and registration succeeds.

cat > landscape.yml <<EOF
#cloud-config
landscape:
  client:
    log_level: "info"
    url: "https://landscape.canonical.com/message-system"
    ping_url: "http://landscape.canonical.com/ping"
    computer_title: "bbsw-testlxd"
    registration_key: "<REDACTED>"
    account_name: "devel"
EOF

$ for release in xenial zesty;
  do
    ref=$release-proposed;
    lxc-proposed-snapshot --proposed --publish $release $ref;
    lxc init $ref $name;
    lxc config set $name user.user-data - < landscape.yml;
    lxc start $name;
    sleep 30; # For landscape install/registration process
    lxc exec $name -- grep account_name /etc/landscape/client.conf; # expect account_name = devel
    lxc exec $name -- egrep 'Using new secure-id.*account devel' /var/log/landscape/broker.log;   # expected live registration success message
  done

[Regression Potential]
Regressions for this sould be limited to python3 environments which formerly didn't have a working landscape config module.
