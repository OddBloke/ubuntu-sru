=== Begin cloud-init SRU Template ===
[Impact]
nova-lxd can provide data to instances in 2 ways:
 a.) metadata service
 b.) config drive

The support for reading the config drive in cloud-init was never
functional.  Nova-lxd has changed the way they're presenting the config
drive to the guest.  Now they are doing so by populating a directory in
the container /config-drive with the information.
The change added to cloud-init was to extend support read config drive
information from that directory.

[Test Case]
With a nova-lxd that contains the fix this can be fully tested
by launching an instance with updated cloud-init and config drive
attached.

For cloud-init, the easiest way to demonstrate this is to
create a lxc container and populate it with a '/config-drive'.

lxc-proposed-snapshot is 
  https://git.launchpad.net/~smoser/cloud-init/+git/sru-info/tree/bin/lxc-proposed-snapshot
It publishes an image to lxd with proposed enabled and cloud-init upgraded.


$ release=xenial
$ ref=xenial-proposed
$ name=$release-lp1673411
$ lxc-proposed-snapshot --proposed --publish $release $ref
$ lxc init $ref $name

# lxc will create the 'NoCloud' seed, and the normal search
# path looks there first, so remove it.

$ lxc file pull $name/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/90_dpkg.cfg - |
    sed 's/NoCloud, //' |
    lxc file push - $name/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/90_dpkg.cfg

## populate a /config-drive with attached 'make-config-drive-dir'
## and push it to the container

$ d=$(mktemp -d)
$ make-config-drive-dir "$d" "$name"
$ rm -Rf "$d"

## start it and look around
$ lxc start $name
$ sleep 10
$ lxc exec $name cat /run/cloud-init/result.json
{
 "v1": {
  "datasource": "DataSourceConfigDrive [net,ver=2][source=/config-drive]",
  "errors": []
 }
}


[Regression Potential] 
There is a potentiali false positive where a user had data in
/config-drive and now that information is read as config drive data.

That would require a directory tree like:
  /config-drive/openstack/2???-??-??/meta_data.json
or
  /config-drive/openstack/latest/meta_data.json

Which seems like a small likelyhood of non-contrived hit.
