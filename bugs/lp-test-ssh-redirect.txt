[Impact]
Users can now disable ssh logins to a non-root user.

[Test Case]
cat > nologin.yaml << EOF
ssh_import_id: chad.smith
#cloud-config
users:
  - default
  - name: nologin
    ssh_redirect_user: true
EOF

cat > setup_proposed.sh <<EOF
#/bin/bash
mirror=http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
echo deb \$mirror \$(lsb_release -sc)-proposed main | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/proposed.list
apt-get update -q;
apt-get install -qy cloud-init;
EOF


for SERIES in xenial bionic; do
   echo '=== BEGIN ' $SERIES;
   EC2_INST=`launch-ec2 --series $SERIES -u nologin.yaml | awk '/Found/{print $5}'`;
   scp setup_proposed.sh $EC2_INST:;
   ssh $EC2_INST sudo bash ./setup_proposed.sh 2>&1 | egrep 'cloud-init';
   ssh $EC2_INST -- sudo cloud-init clean --logs --reboot;
   ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts -R ${EC2_INST/ubuntu@}; sleep 5;
   ssh nologin${EC2_INST/ubuntu};
done
