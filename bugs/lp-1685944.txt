[Impact] 
Rendering of netplan content was broken due to an incorrect
function signature in net/netplan.py:render_network_state.

The end result was that rendering of netplan configuration was
broken in actual usage.  Note, though that no official Ubuntu images
use this path at the current time.  Ubuntu image all use ifupdown.

[Test Case]
The basic idea below is:
 a.) launch an instance with proposed version of cloud-init.
 b.) inside instance, run the test case.  That would stack trace
     as seen in the bug on prior versions of cloud-init.
 c.) show the output.

## launch an instance.
$ release=xenial
$ ref=$release-proposed
$ lxc-proposed-snapshot --proposed --publish $release $ref
$ lxc launch $ref $name
$ lxc exec $name

% cat > render-test.py <<"EOF"
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys
from cloudinit.net import netplan, eni, network_state
out_d = "./out.d" if len(sys.argv) < 2 else sys.argv[1]

cfg = {
    'version': 1,
    'config': [{'name': 'eth1', 'type': 'physical',
               'subnets': [{'type': 'dhcp'}]}]}

# Render eni and netplan to show that they both work.
ns = network_state.parse_net_config_data(cfg)
for renderer in netplan.Renderer(), eni.Renderer():
    print("Rendering %s" % renderer)
    renderer.render_network_state(ns, out_d)
EOF

$ python3 render-test.py out.d
Rendering <cloudinit.net.netplan.Renderer object at 0x7fd197c48208>

$ ( cd out.d && for f in $(find . -type f); do echo == $f ==; cat $f; done )
== ./etc/network/interfaces ==

auto eth1

    ethernets:

            dhcp4: true
== ./etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules ==

$ dpkg-query --show cloud-init

[Regression Potential] 
This specific change has basically zero regression potential as it
was in netplan specific path that was only previously excercised
with test cases.

[Other Info]

lxc-proposed-snapshot is
  https://git.launchpad.net/~smoser/cloud-init/+git/sru-info/tree/bin/lxc-proposed-snapshot
It publishes an image to lxd with proposed enabled and cloud-init upgraded.
