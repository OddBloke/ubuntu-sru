[Impact] 
On Azure, cloud-init handles re-formatting the ephemeral disk.
The contents of the ephemeral disk for a system will be replaced with
a stock ephemeral disk in the following scenarios:
 a.) first boot
 b.) after a resize.
 c.) after a VM has been migrated from one host to another.

That ephemeral disk is either
 1. mbr partitioned with 1 ntfs partition
 2. gpt partitioned with 2 partitions, a msft reserved partition and a
    ntfs partition.  This scenario is newer, and only occurs on
    larger instance types that have large ephemeral disks.

cloud-init previously did not handle '2' above.

[Test Case]
Generically this is re-creatable by:
 1.) launch an instance on Azure
 2.) resize it to a L32 or G5 size
 3.) check to see that the ephemeral disk (/dev/disk/cloud/azure_resource)
     has been formatted to ext4.

It is more easily recreated for testing and verification by:

1. launch instance on azure
2. re-partition the ephemeral disk to look like a "clean" disk above
3. remove old logs, reboot
   $ dir=logs-$(date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M%S");
   $ mkdir -p $dir; mv /var/log/cloud-init* $dir
4. ssh back in, expect that this the disk has an ext4 filesystem on it.
   And that it is mounted on /mnt.

   $ grep reformattable= /var/log/cloud-init.log
   2017-05-12 15:14:57,125 - DataSourceAzure.py[DEBUG]: reformattable=False: partition 1 (/dev/sdb1) on device /dev/disk/cloud/azure_resource was not ntfs formatted

   Or, if it was formatted, you'll see something like:
   2017-05-12 15:17:47,021 - DataSourceAzure.py[DEBUG]: reformattable=True: partition 2 (/dev/sdb2) on device /dev/disk/cloud/azure_resource was ntfs formatted and had no important files. Safe for reformatting.

   $ grep /mnt /proc/mounts 
   /dev/sdb1 /mnt ext4 rw,relatime,data=ordered 0 0


[Regression Potential] 
The change makes cloud-init accept another situation when it decides
to be reformat a disk.  Reformatting of a disk could result in loss of
customer data if the decision to do so results in a false positive.

The fix came with some fairly extensive unit tests (TestCanDevBeReformatted)
on the 'can_dev_be_reformatted' method.
