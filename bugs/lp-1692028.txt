[Impact] 
When the 'ip_gre' module is loaded, the kernel creates two network
devices 'gre0' and 'gretap0' that appear in all network namespaces.
(For example, if you create an lxd container, and then load the ip_gre
module from outside the container, the container will see 2 new
network devices).
The hardware address of these devices is 00:00:00:00:00 as seen below.
   # ( cd /sys/class/net/ && grep . gre*/address )
   gre0/address:00:00:00:00
   gretap0/address:00:00:00:00:00:00

This "duplicate" mac address caused cloud-init to raise a RuntimeError.

The overall impact is that cloudinit's network rendering code will
not work if the ip_gre module is loaded on the system.  That will
happen in some nova-lxd environments, but also anywhere where a user
has loaded that module and is running lxc.

[Test Case]

1.) load a module on your host
    sudo modprobe ip_gre

2.) Launch an instance in lxd.

 $ rel=xenial
 $ name=x1
 $ lxc launch ubuntu-daily:$rel $name

3.) see the stack trace by running 'get_interfaces_by_mac()' in the guest.

 $ lxc exec $name -- \
     python3 -c 'from cloudinit import net; print(net.get_interfaces_by_mac())'

4.) upgrade instance to proposed cloud-init
 $ lxc exec $name -- sh -c '
    mirror=http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
    echo deb $mirror $(lsb_release -sc)-proposed main |
       tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/proposed.list
    apt-get update -q
    apt-get install -qy cloud-init'
 $ lxc exec $name -- dpkg-query --show cloud-init

5.) see that get_interfaces_by_mac() no longer stack traces.   
 $ lxc exec $name -- \
     python3 -c 'from cloudinit import net; print(net.get_interfaces_by_mac())'

A more complete test case is to load an image into nova-lxd with gre
tunneling loaded on the host, but that is much more involved setup.

[Regression Potential] 
Regression potential should be pretty low.  We are simply ignoring
network interfaces not named 'lo' that have a mac address of '00:00:00:00:00'
