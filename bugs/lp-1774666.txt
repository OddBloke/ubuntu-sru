=== Begin cloud-init SRU Template ===
[Impact] 
Virtual devices such as VLANs, bridges and bonds were ignoring MTU settings.
This would result in dropped packets if mtu setting should have been 9000 was
dropped to default of 1500.

[Test Case]
The basic idea below is:
 a.) launch an instance with proposed version of cloud-init.
 b.) inside instance, get cloud-init's network rendering tool from trunk
 c.) run the rendering tool against a config that failed before.
 d.) check rendered netplan config to verify it has mtu settings present.

wget https://git.launchpad.net/~cloud-init-dev/cloud-init/plain/tools/net-convert.py -O net-convert.py

## write a network config with mtu on subnets
cat > subnet-mtu.yaml << EOF
version: 1
config:
  - type: 'physical'
    name: 'iface0'
    mtu: 8999
    subnets:
      - type: static
        address: 192.168.14.2/24
        mtu: 9000
      - type: static
        address: 2001:1::1/64
        mtu: 1500

  lxc exec test-$series -- cat out.d/etc/network/interfaces;
  lxc exec test-$series -- cat out.d/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml;
done


[Regression Potential] 
Fairly low chance for regression this improves ENI and netplan rendering for mtu specific configuration parameters mentioned not being written, and now they will be.
