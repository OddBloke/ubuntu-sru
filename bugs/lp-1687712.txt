[Impact]
If the user specifies cloud-config with a 'fs_setup' entry containing
a 'cmd', then warning will appear in cloud-init.log and expected filesystem
will not be created.

This is because cloud-init would essentially try to execute a name like:
  "mkfs -t TYPE -L LABEL DEVICE"
rather than a name 'mkfs' with arguments '-t', TYPE, ...
No split was done on space.  The fix was to enable
shell intrepretation so that the split would be done.

[Test Case]
This test case assumes a disk will be attached named '/dev/vdb'.
You can change the 'dev=' to be 'sdb' if that will be the device name.
The test cases boots an instance, ads proposed and then 'cleans' the
instance, but similarly this will work if the config is provided
in user-data.

$ dev=vdb
$ sudo tee /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/disk-setup.cfg <<EOF
#cloud-config
disk_setup:
  /dev/$dev:
    table_type: gpt
    layout: [[100, 83]]
 
fs_setup:
 - cmd: mkfs -F -t %(filesystem)s -L %(label)s %(device)s
   filesystem: ext4
   device: /dev/$dev
   partition: 1
   label: repro

mounts:
 - [/dev/${dev}1, /mnt]
EOF

$ sudo rm -Rf /var/lib/cloud /var/log/cloud-init*
## remove the old entry in /etc/fstab, which can cause LP: #1691489
$ sudo sed -i.dist '/comment=cloudconfig/d' /etc/fstab

## wipe the disk so that we make sure we format it.
$ sudo python3 -c "import sys;
buf = b'\\0' * 1024 * 1024 * 8
with open(sys.argv[1], 'wb+') as fp:
   fp.write(buf)
   fp.seek(-(len(buf)), 2)
   fp.write(buf)" /dev/$dev

$ sudo reboot


## Now ssh back in, and expect to have a filesystem on /dev/vdb1
## that is mounted at /mnt

[Regression Potential]
Regression could occur if a user had provided a string to the 'cmd'
argument that had special shell characters in it.
For example:
 cmd: "/my/cmd *foo*"

That would previously have executed the command "/mnt/cmd *foo*", but
will now execute the command /mnt/cmd with argument shell filename
expansion of *foo*
