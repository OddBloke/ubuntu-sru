[Impact]
 Tracebacks in cloud-init logs on Azure for artful+ series for attempts to use ifup ifdown tooling which doesn't exist anymore in cloud-images. hostname updates are still properly handled by waalinuxagent service on all azure images so no observed break in functionality despite cloud-init's inability to perform the hostname bounce itself. This branch doesn't attempt to run ifup or ifdown during hostname bounce if the tool isn't present.

[Test Case]
# Launch an artful instance on Azure and grep for Tracebacks
