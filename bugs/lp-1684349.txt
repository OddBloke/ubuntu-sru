[Impact]
On Openstack instances, when rendering sysconfig output, cloud-init 
would stacktrace due to a TypeError.
This affects runtime only when rendering sysconfig networking, which
is what is used on CentOS and RedHat systems.

[Test Case]
The basic idea below is:
 a.) launch an instance with proposed version of cloud-init.
 b.) inside instance, get cloud-init's network rendering tool from trunk
 c.) run the rendering tool against a config that failed before.
 d.) check rendered netplan config to verify it has the correct format.
     The failed output would have 'addresses' with a format like:
     172.19.1.34/255.255.255.0
     The expected output would be 'cidr' format:
     172.19.1.34/24

## launch an instance.
$ release=xenial
$ ref=$release-proposed
$ lxc-proposed-snapshot --proposed --publish $release $ref
$ lxc launch $ref $name
$ lxc exec $name

## get render tool
% wget https://git.launchpad.net/~cloud-init-dev/cloud-init/plain/tools/net-convert.py -O net-convert.py

## write the network_data.json
% cat > simple-ipv6.yaml <<EOF
version: 1
config:
  - type: physical
    name: eth0
    subnets:
     - type: static
       address: "2000:192:168::5"
       netmask: 64
       routes:
        - netmask: 0
          gateway: "2000:192:168::1"
          network: "::"
EOF

## run the converter
% ./net-convert.py --network-data=simple-ipv6.yaml \
     --kind=yaml --output-kind=eni --directory=out.d

## check the output
% cat out.d/etc/network/interfaces
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet6 static
    address 2000:192:168::5
    netmask 64
    post-up route add -A inet6 default gw 2000:192:168::1 || true
    pre-down route del -A inet6 default gw 2000:192:168::1 || true


## show the cloud-init versions
% dpkg-query --show cloud-init
...

[Regression Potential] 
The fix here was just to make a common networking method accept
a string input as intended rather than only an integer.

The common code changes could shake out other failures in the networking
path.

lxc-proposed-snapshot is

It publishes an image to lxd with proposed enabled and cloud-init upgraded.
