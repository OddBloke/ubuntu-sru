[Impact] 
This code path is not applicable to Ubuntu.
The bug was in supporting dual stack network configuration in
sysconfig (Redhat/centos) format.

[Test Case]
Launch an instance on lxd, make sure it has network.

[Regression Potential] 
Changes to network rendering could have negatively affected Ubuntu
the test above is valid to check that that didn't go horribly wrong.
