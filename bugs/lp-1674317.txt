[Impact]
This bug did not affect yakkety or xenial. it was a regression of 
in a zesty upload and was fixed.

[Test Case]
just run an instance.

1. launch instance in lxd.
2. enable proposed, update, upgrade cloud-init.
3. lxc reboot $name; sleep 10
4. lxc exec $name -- cat /run/cloud-init/result.json
5. lxc exec $name -- grep Traceback /var/log/cloud-init.log

If there is no stack trace in /var/log/cloud-init.log then this 
bug is not present.

[Regression Potential]
The buggy code never made it to a stable release, so a regression
caused by this specific fix is not really possible.
Additionally, look at the commit and you'll convince yourself of
low regression potential.
