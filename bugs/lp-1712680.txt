[Impact]
Automatically regenerating network every reboot of MAAS would effectively trunacte any user-changed network configuration across reboots.

[Test Case]

# Change maas curtin_userdata preseeds for xenial and artful to install cloud-init proposed images
# Per https://gist.github.com/smoser/e917b2873aff767cb454cb0513a564a4#add-proposed-and-install-a-specific-package
$ for release in xenial artful;
  do
    # deploy node via MAAS for this $release;
    ssh ubuntu@<node-ip> grep CODE /etc/os-release;
    ssh ubuntu@<node-ip> "sudo sed -i 's/auto lo/i #SAMIAM' /etc/network/interfaces.d/50-cloud-init.cfg";
    ssh ubuntu@<node-ip> sudo reboot;
    ssh ubuntu@<node-ip> grep SAMIAM etc/network/interfaces.d/50-cloud-init.cfg;
  done

[Regression Potential]
Regression potential is minimal as worst case scenario is that we keep freshing network data as the original bug reported.
