[Impact] 
VMs on MS Azure have an ephemeral disk attached to them.
On first boot, cloud-init properly notices the empty ntfs filesystem and
reformats it ext4.

After deallocating the instance or moving to a new azure host,
the filesystem reformat is logged, but isn't actually performed because
the udev device creation may not have settled.

[Test Case]
Test cases:
 1. Deploy an instance VM on Azure
 2. Log in and ensure that the ephemeral disk is formatted and mounted to /mnt
 3. Via the portal you can "Redeploy" the VM to a new Azure Host (or alternatively stop and deallocate the VM for some time, and then restart/reallocate the VM).

Expected Results:a
 - Check cloud-init.log expecting to see logs from cc_disk_setup about the mount.
 - After reallocation we expect the ephemeral disk to be formatted and mounted to /mnt.

Actual Results:
 - After reallocation /mnt is not mounted and there are errors in the cloud-init log.

[Regression Potential]
