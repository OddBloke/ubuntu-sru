=== Begin SRU Template ===
[Impact] 
When booting with bonds provided in networking configuration, cloud-init
can fail as it attempts to rename the bond device to an interface.

[Test Case]
 * download ubuntu cloud image
 * mount image, enable proposed, update, upgrade cloud-init
 * run 'bond-rename-launch' as provided.
 * login to kvm guest as 'ubuntu:passw0rd'
 * sudo cloud-init init

the 'cloud-init init' above would fail before in an attempt
to rename a bond device.  It will succeed now, as it will realize
that it does not have anything to do.

[Regression Potential] 
Should be small. regressions would be certainly related to
bond or vlan configurations.
