[Impact] 
When booting with vlans provided in networking configuration, cloud-init
can fail as it attempts to rename the vlan device to an interface.

The method 'get_interfaces_by_mac' will raise a RuntimeError as it
notices that the mac address of the vlan is the same as that of the
nic.

$ python3 -c 'from cloudinit.net import get_interfaces_by_mac; print(get_interfaces_by_mac())'

[Test Case]
get-proposed-cloudimg is
  https://git.launchpad.net/~smoser/cloud-init/+git/sru-info/tree/bin/get-proposed-snapshot
It downloads a daily cloud image, and then creates a qcow image backed
by that image with proposed enabled and cloud-init upgraded.

$ get-proposed-cloudimg xenial
$ MODE=vlan ./btest-launch.sh xenial-server-cloudimg-amd64-proposed.img
... log in as ubuntu:password ...
% python3 -c 'from cloudinit.net import get_interfaces_by_mac; print(get_interfaces_by_mac())'

The above will stack trace with RuntimeException on a 4.4 kernel.

[Regression Potential]
TBD.
