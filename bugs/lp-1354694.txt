[Impact] 
A specific usage of user data to cloud-init will fail to add a user.

This cloud-config:
  #cloud-config
  users:
    - default
    - name: foobar
      gecos: "My User"
      groups: sudo, adm

Will fail with information in the cloud-init log showing:
2016-12-19 21:39:32,713 - util.py[WARNING]: Failed to create group  adm
2016-12-19 21:39:32,713 - util.py[DEBUG]: Failed to create group  adm
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
cloudinit.util.ProcessExecutionError: Unexpected error while running command.
Command: ['groupadd', ' adm']
Exit code: 3
Reason: -
Stdout: ''
Stderr: "groupadd: ' adm' is not a valid group name\n"

While changing the last line to the following would work:
      groups: [sudo, adm]

[Test Case]
$ cat > user-data <"EOF"
#cloud-config
users:
  - default
  - name: foobar
    gecos: "My User"
    groups: sudo, adm
  - name: wark
    groups: [sudo, adm]

$ release=yakkety
$ name="$release-1354694"

$ lxc launch "ubuntu-daily:$release" "$name" \
     "--config=user.user-data=$(cat user-data)" 

$ sleep 10

## Check foobar is in expected groups
$ lxc exec $name -- groups foobar
foobar : foobar adm sudo

$ lxc exec $name -- groups wark
wark : wark adm sudo

$ lxc exec $name -- grep WARN /var/log/cloud-init.log || echo "no warn"
no warn

[Regression Potential] 
There are 3 changes in this commit
a.) if 'groups' entry is a string, split on "," and strip pieces
    The most likely path to failure here is if previously a non-string
    (possibly bytes) was being passed in and now will be ignored.
    That seems unlikely and clearly wrong input.

b.) fix and unit tests to explicitly set system=False or no_create_home=True.
    Previously those paths did not test the value of the entry, only the
    presense of the entry.
    This meant that these 2 configs were the same:
      users: {name: bob, system: True}
    and
      users: {name: bob, system: False}

    That bug is fixed here so that 'system: False' is just explicitly
    disabling the '--system' flag to adduser.

c.) debug message cleanup:

   LOG.debug("created group %s for user %s", name, group)
   LOG.debug("created group '%s' for user '%s'", group, name)
