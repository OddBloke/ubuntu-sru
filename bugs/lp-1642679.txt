=== Begin SRU Template ===
[Impact] 
When a config drive provides network_data.json on Azure OpenStack,
cloud-init will fail to configure networking.

Console log and /var/log/cloud-init.log will show:
 ValueError: Unknown network_data link type: hyperv

This woudl also occur when the type of the network device as declared
to cloud-init was 'hw_veb', 'hyperv', or 'vhostuser'.

[Test Case]
Launch an instance with config drive on hyperv cloud.

[Regression Potential] 
Low to none.   cloud-init is relazing requirements and will accept things
now that it previously complained were invalid.
