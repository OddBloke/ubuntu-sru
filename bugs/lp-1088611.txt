[Impact]
Prior to this fix, cloud-init attempts to detect dns redirection by doing
dns queries for a random hostname and two invalid hostnames.  Then, if
the result returned for the input value was the same as the response for
the invalid query cloud-init would assume that result was also invalid.

The change was to replace the random string with
  __cloud_init_expected_not_found__
This is a valid hostname and resolution will use the 'search' path in
resolv.conf where the other invalid domain names would not.

[Test Case]
The test case for this consists of excercising the the 'is_resolvable_url'
method in cloudinit.util and watching dns queries.  To do this, see the
following steps:
a.) start an lxc container
   $ release=xenial
   $ name=$release-1088611
   $ lxc launch ubuntu-daily:$release $name
b.) start a dnsmasq server
   $ ./run-dnsmasq lxdbr0
   ... 
   === listening on 10.75.205.2/24 ===

   # run-dnsmasq is attached and at
   #  https://git.launchpad.net/~smoser/cloud-init/+git/sru-info/tree/bugs/lp-1088611/run-dnsmasq

c.) point /etc/resolv.conf at your server ip
   $ lxc exec $name -- sh -c 'exec >/etc/resolv.conf;
       echo nameserver 10.75.205.2; echo search foo;'

d.) perform query via is_resolvable_url watch dnsmasq output, expect
    to see the random query.
   $ lxc exec $name -- python3 -c 'import sys;
from cloudinit.util import is_resolvable_url; 
print(is_resolvable_url(sys.argv[1]))' http://ubuntu.com

e.) upgrade to -proposed version
f.) perform query via is_resolvable_url, expect to *not* see random query.

[Regression Potential]
Immediate regression seems unlikely.  Effectively the change in cloud-init
code path was simply to change a dns lookup attempt from rand() to a defined
string.

We chose a random string initially to make it difficult for a dns server to
circumvent cloud-init's attempt to identify dns redirection.  The regression
path really then seems to involve a dns redirection service specifically
provding a response for '__cloud_init_expected_not_found__' that differs
from does-not-exist.example.com.  Cloud-init could then be tricked into
believing that a apt mirror was valid where it previously would have
identified the dns redirection.  The failure would be seen as errors
in package installation or 'apt-get update'.
