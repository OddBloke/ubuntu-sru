[Impact]
Cloud-init logs should now contain full packaged version of cloud-init on xenial, artful and bionic.

[Test Case]
# We should see specific version and patch information
$ packaged_version=$(dpkg-query --show -f '${version}' cloud-init)
$ grep $packaged_version /var/log/cloud-init.log  # Expect to stage header logs
...
2018-07-10 19:33:16,406 - util.py[DEBUG]: Cloud-init v. 18.3-9-g2e62cb8a-0ubuntu1 running 'init-local' at Tue, 10 Jul 2018 19:33:16 +0000. Up 1.00 seconds.

# Also, cloud-init --version should show the packaged version
# it should contain a -0ubuntu portion.

$ cloud-init --version
/usr/bin/cloud-init 18.3-9-g2e62cb8a-0ubuntu1

[Regression Potential]
This really should be low chance of regression.  The chance would be
if something is running 'cloud-init --version' and parsing the output,
or parsing the output of /var/log/cloud-init.log (or the console log).

Such specific parsing of a log seems brittle anyway. Parsing output
of --version that expected to not have a -0ubuntuX in it would need to
be updated.
