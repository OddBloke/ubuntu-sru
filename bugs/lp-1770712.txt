=== Begin SRU Template ===
[Impact]
Cloud-init logs should now contain full packaged version of cloud-init on xenial, artful and bionic.

[Test Case]
# We should see specific version and patch information
packaged_version=`dpkg-query --show -f '${version}' cloud-init`
grep $packaged_version /var/log/cloud-init.log  # Expect to stage header logs

[Regression Potential]
This really should be low chance of regression.  The chance would be
if something is running 'cloud-init --version' and parsing the output,
or parsing the output of /var/log/cloud-init.log (or the console log).

Such specific parsing of a log seems brittle anyway. Parsing output
of --version that expected to not have a -0ubuntuX in it would need to
be updated.
