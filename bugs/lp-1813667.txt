=== Begin SRU Template ===
[Impact]

cloud-init doesn't accurately express its dependencies.

[Test Case]

```
# Only affects releases with netplan; i.e. bionic and later
for SERIES in bionic cosmic disco; do
   echo '=== BEGIN ' $SERIES
   ref=$SERIES-proposed
   lxc delete test-$SERIES --force 2> /dev/null
   lxc-proposed-snapshot -p -P $SERIES $ref | egrep 'Creating|cloud-init'
   lxc launch $ref test-$SERIES
   lxc exec test-$SERIES -- cloud-init status --wait --long
   lxc exec test-$SERIES -- apt-cache show cloud-init | grep nplan && echo FAILURE || echo SUCCESS
   lxc exec test-$SERIES -- dpkg -s ifupdown > /dev/null && echo FAILURE || echo SUCCESS
done
```

[Regression Potential]

cloud-init could end up pulling in ifupdown if the new dependency is expressed
incorrectly, which would be caught by the above test case.
