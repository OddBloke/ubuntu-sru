[Impact]
cloud-init takes network configuration input in a variety of formats.
It then applies that network configuration, including renaming devices
based on their mac address and provided name.

If the mac address provided contained upper case letters (hex values,
so A-F) then cloud-init would fail to rename the devices and show a
WARN message in /var/log/cloud-init.log.

The warn message would look like:
  Failed to rename devices: [nic not present] Cannot rename 
    mac=00:16:3E:FC:3D:65 to eth0, not available.

[Test Case]
The basic idea below is:
 a.) launch an lxd instance with proposed version of cloud-init.
 b.) inside instance, change the provided network config to use upper case
     for mac addresses.
 c.) clean the system and reboot.
 d.) check no errors in /var/log/cloud-init.log

## launch an instance.

[Regression Potential]
Regression potential here should be very low.  The fix was essentially to
be more liberal on matching mac addresses by using '.lower()' on both values.

lxc-proposed-snapshot is
  https://git.launchpad.net/~smoser/cloud-init/+git/sru-info/tree/bin/lxc-proposed-snapshot
It publishes an image to lxd with proposed enabled and cloud-init upgraded.
