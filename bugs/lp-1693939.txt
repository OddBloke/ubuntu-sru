[Impact]
Azure identifies itself to guests by setting providing a well known value in
the chassis asset field of dmi data.  This is done both in Azure public cloud
and in Azure Stack (the on-premise variant of Azure).

By checking for this value cloud-init can more quickly identify whether
or not it is running on Azure.

[Test Case]
 - Launch an instance, enable proposed, upgrade.
 - Clean instance and re-boot
   $ rm -Rf /var/lib/cloud /var/log/cloud-init* 
   $ rm -f /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/91_walinuxagent.cfg  # bug 1700769
   $ reboot

 - ssh back in look around
   - check for 'WARN' in /var/log/cloud-init*
   - look in /run/cloud-init/ds-identify.log.  It should say:
      Found single datasource: Azure
 
 - reboot, ssh back in and verify all still good.


[Regression Potential]
Instances running in Azure or Azure Stack that did *not* have this value
would not be identified as Azure.  We have been told by representatives
from Microsoft that that will not be the case.
