[Impact] 
When running on a Redhat RDO install (such as Finnish provider Nebula),
instances will show a warning on ssh login or in the cloud-init.log file.

This was by design, as we wanted to find places where ds-identify was
not working correctly.

[Test Case]
1. Launch an instance on a RDO deployed cloud
2. enable proposed, upgrade
3. rm -Rf /var/lib/cloud /var/log/cloud*
4. reboot
5. ssh back in, expect to see no warning.

[Regression Potential] 
regression potential is low.  The code change made here
was just to consider either 'OpenStack Nova' or 'OpenStack Compute'
as identifying openstack where previously only the 'Nova' string
was considered.  This does provide a larger potential for false-positive
in identifying a non-openstack cloud as openstack, but that should
be seemingly small.
