[Impact]
There is a race condition on a re-deployment of cloud-init on Azure
where /mnt will not get properly formatted or mounted.  This is due to
"dirty" entries in /etc/fstab that cause a device to be busy when
cloud-init goes to format it.  This shows itself usually as 'mkfs'
complaining that the device is busy.  The cause is that systemd
starts an fsck and collides with cloud-init re-formatting the disk.

The problem can be seen other places but seemed to be most reproducible
and originally found on Azure.

[Test Case]
1.) Launch a Azure vm, ideally size L32S.
2.) Log in and verify the system properly mounted /mnt.
3.) Re-deploy the vm through the web ui and try again.

[Regression Potential]
Worst case scenario, these changes unnecessarily slow down boot and 
do not fix the problem.
