[Impact]
Ec2 support to of network configuration for ipv6-configured interfaces was not supported.


[Test Case]

1. launch an instance in ec2 on an ipv6 network with an allocated ipv6 address on the interface
2. allocate an ipv6 address to the network interface (as well as ipv4)
3. sudo rm -rf /var/log/cloud-init* /var/lib/cloud; sudo reboot
4. grep 'Applying network config' /var/log/cloud-init.log # look for dhcp6


[Regression Potential]
dhcp6 support is added above and beyond dhcp4 support. Confirm the dhcp-only instances also receive just dhcp4 config.
