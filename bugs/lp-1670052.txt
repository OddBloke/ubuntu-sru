[Impact] 
When rendering sysconfig (redhat/centos) output there was a bug
where cloud-init would error if provided with more than 3 nameservers.

That was changed to a warning.

[Test Case]
This can't really be tested on Ubuntu, as ubuntu does not render
sysconfig network information.

[Regression Potential] 
Low everywhere (change ValueError to a WARN) and lower on Ubuntu,
where the code is not in the run path.
