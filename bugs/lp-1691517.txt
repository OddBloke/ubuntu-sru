[Impact] 
Unit tests for cloud-init did not run successfully in a centos environment.
This is really just failure of the unit tests.

The fix was to no longer expect /sbin/mkfs.ext4 but to mock the checking.

[Test Case]
Test of ubuntu package in centos is non-trivial and/or not useful.
The proposed test case is to just run the trunk tests at the
uploaded git commit in a lxc container (the environment that originally
found the issue).

$ lxc launch images:centos/7 c7
$ sleep 10; # let it boot
$ lxc exec c7 -- /bin/sh -xe <<"EOF"
yum install --assumeyes epel-release
yum install --assumeyes pyserial python-argparse python-cheetah python-configobj python-jinja2 python-jsonpatch python-oauthlib python-prettytable python-requests python-six python-pip PyYAML git file e2fsprogs
pip install contextlib2 httpretty mock nose pep8 unittest2
git clone https://git.launchpad.net/cloud-init
cd cloud-init
git checkout 16a7302f
nosetests tests/unittests
EOF


[Regression Potential]
No runtime regression potential.
Unit test only changes.
