[Impact]
A new feature in Azure allows instances the ability to utilize
SR-IOV networking.  Currently, Ubuntu images will fail to boot there.

[Test Case]
Testing this comes in the following parts:
a.) check that no regressions have leaked in outside of Azure.
b.) upgraded instance without SR-IOV device upgrade and reboot.
c.) fresh instance with SR-IOV and updated cloud-init and reboot.
d.) fresh instance without SR-IOV and updated cloud-init and reboot.

The cases above generally verify that users have not been exposed
to unexpected changes in behavior, and that the fix is correctly
applied.

After each boot, the user should collect logs, and generally look around
for evidence of failure.  One tool that can be used to collected these
logs is 'save-old-data' at [1].  That checks for many common issues with
systemd boot.

[Regression Potential]
The majority of the changes have been limited to the Azure code path.
Regressions then are likely limited to Azure users, and would most
likely present themselves as network configuration failures on reboot
or first boot.
