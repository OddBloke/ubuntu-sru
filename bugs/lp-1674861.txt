[Impact] 
When running on a Google Compute (GCE),
instances may show a warning on ssh login or in the cloud-init.log file.

This was by design, as we wanted to find places where ds-identify was
not working correctly.

This seems to only occur on older instances.  The original reporter
cannot re-create  it on a new instance. The reason for the behavior
change is that the new instances have different smbios information.
Presumably this is because the mechanism for launching the new 
instances has been changed to include 'Google Compute' in the Product
Name where previously only 'Google' appeard.

[Test Case]
Note, you'd have to have an old instance to actually see this.
So this is not really easy to test the fix.
The test for no regression is easier:

1. Launch an instance on a GCE.
2. enable proposed, upgrade
3. rm -Rf /var/lib/cloud /var/log/cloud*
4. reboot
5. ssh back in, expect to see no warning.

[Regression Potential] 
Very low.  the change was just to consider an a dmi product serial
number with 'GoogleCloud-*' as a indication that we are running on
Google Compute.  That would seem a very low false-positive rate.
