[Impact]
Network configuration provided to cloud-init that has an ipv6 address
and additional manual default route will fail to bring up the routes
correctly.

[Test Case]
The basic idea below is:
 a.) launch an instance with proposed version of cloud-init.
 b.) inside instance, get cloud-init's network rendering tool from trunk
 c.) run the rendering tool against a config that failed before.
 d.) check rendered ENI config to verify it looks correct.

## launch an instance.
$ release=xenial
$ ref=$release-proposed
$ lxc-proposed-snapshot --proposed --publish $release $ref
$ lxc launch $ref $name
$ lxc exec $ref $name /bin/bash

## get render tool
% wget https://git.launchpad.net/~cloud-init-dev/cloud-init/plain/tools/net-convert.py -O net-convert.py

% cat > net-config.yaml <<"EOF"
version: 1
config:
 - type: physical
   name: eth0
   mac_address: "c0:d6:9f:2c:e8:80"
   subnets:
    - type: static
      address: "2001:1::2/64"
      routes:
       - gateway: "2001:4800:78ff:1b::1"
         netmask: "::"
         network: "::"
EOF

$ python3 ./net-convert.py \
    --network-data=net-config.yaml --kind=yaml \
    --output-kind=eni \
    --mac=eth0,c0:d6:9f:2c:e8:80 \
    --directory=out.d

% cat out.d/etc/network/interfaces
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet6 static
    address 2001:1::2/64
    post-up route add -A inet6 default gw 2001:4800:78ff:1b::1 || true
    pre-down route del -A inet6 default gw 2001:4800:78ff:1b::1 || true


## The output above is the expected output.  The failure path
## would have post-up and pre-down like:
    post-up route add -net :: netmask :: gw 2001:4800:78ff:1b::1 || true
    pre-down route del -net :: netmask :: gw 2001:4800:78ff:1b::1 || true

[Regression Potential]
Regressions for this change are almost certainly limited to
rendering of ipv6 networking configuration and most likely limited
to routing.
