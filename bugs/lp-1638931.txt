[Impact]
Ubuntu cloud-images do not identify the Aliyun cloud platform.
Until this change was put in place, they would fail to boot and consume
user-data or metadata there.

With the change in place, an official Ubuntu image from 
http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com will work properly on Aliyun.

[Test Case]
The ideal test case is:
a.) download a cloud image, update its cloud-init
    The tool 'get-proposed-cloudimg' [1] can be used to do this.

b.) publish that image to Aliyun cloud
c.) boot an instance from that image.
d.) verify function by ssh in verifying /run/cloud-init/result.json shows
    that aliyun datasource was used.

Ideally post /var/log/cloud-init.log as an attachment to this bug.

[Regression Potential]
Generally small chance for regression, but a regression would most likely
be seen as an attempt to hit the metadata service at the well known end point
http://100.100.100.200.

This should be fairly well confined as attempts to use the Aliyun datasource
are gated by '_is_aliyun_' which does verifies that the dmi product name is
"Alibaba Cloud ECS"
